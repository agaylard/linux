Sunplus SP7021 SoC interrupt controller

Required properties:
 - compatible: should be "sunplus,sp7021-intc"
 - interrupt-controller: identifies the node as an interrupt controller
 - #interrupt-cells: specifies the number of cells needed to encode an interrupt
                     source, should be 2.
 - reg: addresses and length of the register sets for interrupt controller.
 - interrupt-parent: phandle to the parent interrupt controller.
 - interrupts: specifies the interrupt lines to the interrupt-parent controller
               The first item is interrupt type, the second is interrupt number,
               and the latest is trigger type.
 - ext0-mask: cpu affiniity of EXT_INT0
 - ext1-mask: cpu affiniity of EXT_INT1
   - mask:
     Setting bit 0 to 1 means the interrupt will be sent to core 0.
     Setting bit 1 to 1 means the interrupt will be sent to core 1.
     Setting bit 2 to 1 means the interrupt will be sent to core 2.
     Setting bit 3 to 1 means the interrupt will be sent to core 3.

Example:
intc: interrupt-controller@0x9c000780 {
	compatible = "sunplus,sp7021-intc";
	interrupt-controller;
	#interrupt-cells = <2>;
	reg = <0x9c000780 0x80>, <0x9c000a80 0x80>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 5 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>, /* EXT_INT0 */
		     <GIC_SPI 6 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>; /* EXT_INT1 */
	ext0-mask = <0xf>; /* core0-3 */
	ext1-mask = <0xe>; /* core1-3 */
};
