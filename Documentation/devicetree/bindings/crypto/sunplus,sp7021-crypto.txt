Sunplus SP7021 SoC Crypto Engines / Security Accelerator (SEC)

Required properties:
- compatible : Should contain entries for this and backward compatible
- reg : Offset and length of the register set for the device
- clocks : phandle to clock-controller plus clock-specifier pair
- resets : phandles to the reset lines needed for this power demain sequence
	as described in ../reset/reset.txt
- interrupt-parent : phandle to the parent interrupt controller.
- interrupts : the SEC's interrupt number

Example:

	crypto: crypto@G84 {
		compatible = "sunplus,sp7021-crypto";
		reg = <0x9c002a00 0x100>; /* G84 ~ G85 */
		clocks = <&clkc SEC>;
		resets = <&rstc RST_SEC>;
		interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
		interrupts = <148 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	};
