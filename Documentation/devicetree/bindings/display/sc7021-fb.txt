Sunplus SC7021 series SoC Graphics Backend framebuffer driver

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "sunplus,sc7021-fb"
- memory-region: phandle to a node describing memory.

Example:

fb_reserve: fb_device {
	compatible = "sunplus,sc7021_fb_device_mem";
	size = <0x802000>;	//1366*768*4 alignment 1024, and double buffer.
	alignment = <1024>;
	reusable;
};

fb_device {
	compatible = "sunplus,sc7021-fb";
	memory-region = <&fb_reserve>;
};
