Device-Tree bindings of sp_rtc device

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be
				"sunplus,sp7021-rtc" for sp7021
				"sunplus,q645-rtc" for q645
- reg: Physical base address and length of the controller's register
- clocks: Clock phandles (see clock-controller for details)
- resets: Reset phandles (see reset-controller for details)
- interrupt-parent: Interrupt phandles (see interrupt-controller for details)
- interrupts: interrupt number to the cpu.

Example:

rtc: serial@sp_rtc {
			compatible = "sunplus,sp7021-rtc";
			reg = <0x9c003A00 0x80>;
			reg-names = "rtc_reg";
			clocks = <&clkc RTC>;
			resets = <&rstc RST_RTC>;
			interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
			interrupts = <163 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
};
