Device-Tree bindings of sp_spinand device

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be
				"sunplus,sunplus,sp7021-spinand" for bch of sp7021
				"sunplus,sunplus,q645-spi-nand" for bch of q645
- reg: Physical base address and length of the controller's register
- interrupt-parent: Interrupt phandles (see interrupt-controller for details)
- interrupts: interrupt number to the cpu.
- clocks: Clock phandles (see clock-controller for details)
- resets: Reset phandles (see reset-controller for details)

Example:

	spinand0: spinand@sp_spinand {
		compatible = "sunplus,sp7021-spinand";
		reg = <0x9c002B80 0x50>;
		interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
		interrupts = <149 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		linux,part-probe = "ofpart", "sunplus_part";
		clocks = <&clkc SPIND>;
		resets = <&rstc RST_SPIND>;
	};
