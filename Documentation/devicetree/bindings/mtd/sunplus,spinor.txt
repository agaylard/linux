Sunplus SPI NOR flash controller
--------------------------------

The device node of Sunplus SPI NOR flash controller has following properties.

Required properties:
 - compatible: should be "sunplus,sp-spi-nor".
 - reg: addresses and length of the register sets for SPI-NOR flash controller.
 - interrupt-parent: phandle for interrupt parent.
 - interrupts: number and type of interrupt, type should be high-level.
 - clocks: clock selector for SPI-NOR flash controller.
 - resets: reset controller selector for SPI-NOR flash controller.
 - spi-max-frequency: Maximum frequency of the SPI bus the chip can operate at.
 - spi-chip-selection: Selection of chip of SPI-NOR chip.
 - read-timing-selection: timing adjust for read.
 - write-timing-selection: timeing adjust for write.
 - pinctrl-names: Names corresponding to the numbered pinctrl states.
 - pinctrl-0: phandle for the 'default' state of pin configuration.

Example:

sp_spinor0: spinor@9C000B00 {
	compatible = "sunplus,sp-spi-nor";
	reg = <0x9C000B00 0x80>, <0x9c000080 0x80>;
	interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
	interrupts = <143 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	clocks = <&clkc SPIFL>;
	resets = <&rstc RST_SPIFL>;
	spi-max-frequency = <50000000>;
	spi-chip-selection = <0>;
	read-timing-selection = <1>;
	write-timing-selection = <1>;
	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&spi_flash2_mux &spi_fla4b2_mux>;
};
