Sunplus Soc Co-Processor Bindings

This binding provides support for ARM926/Cortex M4 Co-processor found on some
Sunplus SoCs.

Required properties:
- compatible ï¼šShould contain entries for this and backward compatible
- reg : Offset and length of the register set for the device
- interrupt-parent : phandle to the parent interrupt controller.
- interrupts : the device's interrupt number
- resets : phandles to the reset lines needed for this power demain sequence
	as described in ../reset/reset.txt
- memory-region : Reserved memory (See: ../reserved-memory/reserved-memory.txt)

Optional properties:
- firmware : Co-processor firmware filename

Example:

	remoteproc0: remoteproc@0 {
		compatible = "sunplus,sp_remoteproc";
		firmware = "firmware";
		reg = <0 0xf8007ffc 0 4>; /* mbox G255.31, cpu0 to cpu2 direct reg07 */
		interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 125 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>; /* CPU2_TO_0_DIRECT_INT7 */
		resets = <&rstc RST_CM4>;
		memory-region = <&rproc_0_reserved>, <&vdev0buffer>, <&vdev0vring0>, <&vdev0vring1>;
	};
